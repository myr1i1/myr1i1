- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **python**. That's not much 'cause I'm at the very beginning of my computer science path. But there's more to come and I'm intersted to learn new prospects!--

- ðŸ˜‹ **Beside computer science:** I'm quite intersed in biology and math - these ones are my favorite subjects. My hobbies are playing videogames *(fav ones: Resident evil, The last of us, Life is strange, The witcher 3, etc.),* watching series in original *(Shameless, Yellowjackets, House M.D, etc.).* I used to draw and do web design, participate in vocal and hip-hop dance studio. When I have free time I like photographing, skiing and cooking. That's all too basic but it'll help you to get to know me better!
